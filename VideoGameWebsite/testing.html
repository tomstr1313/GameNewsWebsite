                                  <p>
                                  After a private beta, PS4's big 5.0 update is now available for everyone. In short, there are few huge features included in the update, but lots of small improvements that should improve the system's functionality overall. The patch weighs in at 375 MB, and it's mandatory to install--just turn your PS4 on and the update should begin downloading automatically.

                                       <p> Update: Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness is now free on PS4 as well as PS Vita in the US. However, you may have to 'purchase' the game on PS4 and PS Vita separately, since it is not normally part of Sony's Cross-Buy scheme. The below text has been altered to reflect the change. Original story follows.It's the start of a new month--and a new year--which means more free games are now available for PlayStation Plus subscribers. January's allotment of free PS Plus games are out now on the PlayStation Store, meaning that titles like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and Batman: The Telltale Series have temporarily dropped to the low, low price of free for paying subscribers.

                                  <p>
                                 FIFA 18's first update is out now for the PC version, making a series of changes across modes such as Ultimate Team, The Journey: Hunter Returns, and gameplay overall.
                            For Ultimate Team, this patch adds new functionality for missed shots, while the update also fixes an issue where the crowd had the wrong flags if the home team was wearing a certain jersey. There was also an issue where you could control the keeper in single-player that has now been fixed.

                           <p>For a moment, a new solid-state drive was visible on Samsung's website; the 4TB 860 Pro. However, its $1900 USD price tag is what caught the most attention. Nothing has been officially announced by the company, but a few specs were leaked alongside the costly MSRP.
                           The price may not come as a surprise to some considering the Samsung 850 Evo SSD currently goes for $1600 USD for the 4TB model and the unofficially revealed 860 Pro offers slightly better read and write speeds. The 860 Pro was shown to have a sequential read speed up to 560 MB/s and a sequential write speed up to 530 MB/s; this equates to a 20 MB/s and 10 MB/s improvement, respectively. The practical result is faster boot, load, and installation times.</p>

That made it the single-largest data breach ever in terms of the number of accounts. Today, Yahoo announced that it was even worse. All 3 billion of its accounts were compromised.
                                   Yahoo said in a news release that it "obtained new intelligence" with the help of of "outside forensic experts." Based on this new information, Yahoo can now say that "all Yahoo user accounts were affected" by the August 2013 breach.</p>
